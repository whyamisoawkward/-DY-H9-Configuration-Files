# -DY-H9-Configuration-Files

                                            DY-H9 3D Printer Marlin Configuration Files

     I have retrofitted the DY-H9 with a Makerbase Robin Nano V2 with a TFT3.5 screen. I have also redesigned the enclosures for the control board, screen and power supply.  I am currently printing with  PLA + as a test and find great accuracy printing at a %65 flow rate. I may have to mess with the steps on the extruder after I switch to some more conventional PLA but this is a work in progress and I don’t have any regular PLA to test with at the moment.
